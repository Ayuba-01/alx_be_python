# Objective: Utilize Python lists to create a simple shopping list manager that allows users to add items, view the current list, and remove items.

# Task Description:
# Create a Python script named shopping_list_manager.py that implements a simple interface for managing a shopping list. This task focuses on using lists to store and manipulate data dynamically.

# Requirements:
# Core Functionality:

# Your script should start with an empty list named shopping_list.
# Implement functionality to add items to the list, remove items, and display the current list.
# User Interface:

# Use a loop to continuously display a menu with options to the user until they choose to exit. The menu should offer options to add an item, remove an item, view the list, and exit.
# For adding items, prompt the user for the item name and append it to shopping_list.
# For removing items, ask the user for the item name and remove it from shopping_list. If the item is not found, display a message indicating so.
# To view the list, print each item in shopping_list to the console.
# Ensure your script handles invalid menu choices gracefully.

def display_menu():
    print("Shopping List Manager")
    print("1. Add Item")
    print("2. Remove Item")
    print("3. View List")
    print("4. Exit")

def main():
    shopping_list = []
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == '1':
            # Prompt for and add an item
            answer = input("Enter the item to add: ").capitalize()
            shopping_list.append(answer)
        elif choice == '2':
            # Prompt for and remove an item
            answer = input("Enter the item to remove: ").capitalize()
            if answer in shopping_list:
                shopping_list.remove(answer)
            else:
                print(f"{answer} doesn't exit in the shopping list.")
        elif choice == '3':
            # Display the shopping list
            print (shopping_list)
        elif choice == '4':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
